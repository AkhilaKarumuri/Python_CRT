Graphs:-
A graph is a pair G=(V.E) where V is a set whose elements are called vertices and E is a set of two sets of vertices whose elements are called edges
GRAPH OPERATINS:
1.Add Vertex
2.Add edge
3.Remove Vertex
4.Remove Edge
5.Display Graph
6.Traversal
7.View Edges
8.Get Neighbour Nodes
Graph Terminology:
1.Nodes are named verctices, and the connection between them are called as edges.
2.Two vertices are said to be adjacent if there exists a direct edge connecting them.
3.The degree of a node is defined as the number of edges that are incident to it
4.A path is a collection of edges through which we can reach from one node to the other node in Graph
5.A graph is said to be connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices.
6.number of edges means N*(N-1)/2 edges
7.This is the maximum number of edges that a graph can have.

DFS(Depth First Search):is a graph teaversal algorithm that starts from a source node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
It uses a stack (either explicity pr via recursion) and goes deep into one path before tying others.

BFS(Breath First Search)is an algorithm where we start from the selected node and treverse the graph level-wise pr layer -wise,thus exlopring the neighbour nodes (which are directly connected to starting node),and then moving on to the next  level neighbour node
1.We first move horizontanlly and visit all the nodes of the current layer
2.Then move to the next layer.
