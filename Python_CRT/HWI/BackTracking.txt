A back tracking is a problem-solving algorithm that uses abrute force approach for finding the desired output
The brute force approach tries out all the possible solutions
There are three types of problems in baccktracking:
Decision Problem: In this we search for feasable solution
Optimization Problem: In this, we search for the best solution
Enumeration Problem: In this, we find all feasable solutions
Difference between Recursion and Backtracking:
In recursion the function calls itself until it reaches the base case.
